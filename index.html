        <p class="preppg">
            Hello everybody, during this project we learned about: saving water, keeping our <br>
            water sources clean, why we need water and the importance of water. <br>
            Saving water is crucial for our society because water is life and without water <br>
            we can't fulfill our daily needs. <br>
            Conserving water <br>
            We learned that we need to practice conserving water so anytime we have any <br>
            water shortages, we can use the conserved water to fulfill our needs. We <br>
            learned that keeping water clean is super important for our school and also <br>
            our community. We learned that we should keep our schools water sources <br>
            clean so we can have healthy clean water. We often use the saying “leave the <br>
            bathroom how you wish to find it” so it can remind us of how important clean <br>
            water is. We hope you like our project as much as we did!</p>

            Our schools water map represents where we have a water source that we can use for <br>
            different school needs. <br>
            We have our P.E washrooms in our changing rooms, we use these bathrooms for <br>
            drinking water washing our hands etc, <br>
            Then we have our regular bathrooms that we use for basic needs, but also since the art <br>
            classroom is close we use it to fill up water for different types of artwork we do. <br>
            I <br>
            Then we have the teachers haul faucet. In break teachers can use this faucet to make <br>
            tea, drink water, wash their hands etc. <br>
            Now last up we have our schools backyard, in this backyard we have lots of trees and <br> 
            flowers and nature in general. In our backyard, we have a hose to water our plants, but <br> 
            theres a leaking pipe that is unfortunately still not fixed. <br>
            What the symbols mean: <br>
            The faucet means where we can wash our hands drink water fill up water etc. <br>
            The toilet means where we can do our personal needs. <br>
            The leaking pipe means a pipe that is still not fixed at leaks water <br>
            The hose is a tool we use to water our backyards plants and to fill up water.</p>

            <p class="thp">
                There is a faucet in our school's <br>
                teachers' hall. The water of the faucets <br> 
                is drinkable. The teachers can drink <br> 
                water from the faucet, wash their hands <br> 
                etc... <br> <br>

                Our school has many teachers. In the <br>
                teachers hall there is only one faucet. I <br>
                would put more faucets in the teachers <br>
                hall so they have easier access to water.

                In our PE locker there is a very small <br>
                bathroom with a faucet and a toilet, that <br>
                we use after PE to wash our hands and <br>
                other reasons. <br> <br>

                Our PE bathroom is very small and it only <br> 
                has one faucet. Since there's lots of <br> 
                students at our school I would think to <br> 
                make bigger bathrooms and more faucets

            <p class="blinap">I would happily finish this project off by saying how only a little bit of change to your <br>
                water usage routine can do so much. Even the tiniest amount of  water could mean <br>
                so much for a lot of people, because <br>
                not all environments have open access to water. Instead of taking longer showers, <br>
                leaving the faucet on, pouring or spilling <br>
                water without an actual reason, do the opposite  <br> 
                and start to conserve water and take care of <br>
                your lakes, rivers, creeks, ponds, swamps and ocean from of which thousands of <br>
                people obtain free water from. This is very important for them because humans need <br>
                water to survive and the healthy amount of water you need to drink in a day is 3.7 <br> 
                liters but not everyone can afford 15.5 cups of safe and fresh water per day. My point <br>
                is that all these little differences can make so many changes, so i recommend you <br>
                start to be more water wise, too.</p>
